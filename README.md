# Midterm Website

## Information Architect

This website is divided in this way:
- A home page that uses Z-pattern to catch the reader's attention. 
- There are subpages that are for the All Blacks rugby players. There are content in these websites to talk about each players. 

### Ontology

The Ontology for this website is given straight forward. It is about New Zealand Rugby Players (All Blacks). The navigation tags in the subpages provide reader to visit different player's description. The headings are related to the rugby topic, "Summary", "Statistics" and "Position". These headings provide reader to compare each player and understand more on depth about the sport of Rugby. 

### Taxonomy 

The purpose of this website is to attract the reader to get to know more about New Zealand Rugby Team, as well as talk about the three New Zealand Rugby players in depth. 

### Choreography

The main topics about this website are the three players, "Dan Carter", "Jonah Lomu" and "Richie Mccaw". The order of the players are solely based on alphabetical order, but not for the headings. 

Headings are in the order of "Summary", "Statistics" and Position. The reason why I placed in this order was because I believe it is better to explain the player's brief information first. For all three players in the summary section, I talked about what are they known for and why they are considered to be a great rugby player. 

For the "Statistics" heading, I decided to add three data of "Matches Played", "Winning Percentage" and "Points Scored". From the reference, ESPN, I thought this three simple data will show how these rugby players are great. Obviously, in the "Points Scored" data, Dan Carter had a highest points but these data are based on what position they played in. Therefore, that is why I added the last heading of "Position"
to explain each position's requirements as well as the role in the game. 

"Position" heading was to explain three different positions in the rugby that my website's players played. I listed out the requirements of how to play the three position and their expectations. This way, at least the reader knows which position fits him/her out of three positions. 

The big idea of "Position" heading was to show that depending on the position, players have different numbers in each data and reader should not judge player's ability based on numbers only. For example, Dan Carter made 1598 points, but that is because his position (Fly Half) requires him to score points all of the time. However, Richie Mccaw only has 135 points, because his job is not to make points. He is in a forward position, so he is expected to tackle players and gain more territory for the team. 

## Designer 

### Z Pattern Explanation 

I used the Z pattern in the index page, which is the first page the reader will see. For this page, I decided to create 4 different sections and adjust the positioning for the each section. For the primary area, I wanted the reader to see the All Blacks logo right away and get curious on the image. On the Strong area, I added newsletter because our main focus in this project was to make sure reader was signing up to our newsletter. I wanted to add to the strong area so that reader will get curious on the logo and goes through the newsletter to sign up to my website. Between strong and weak area, I added catchy quote from Richie Mccaw so that people can understand that Rugby is intense sport and requires hard work to accomplish great things. On weak area, I wanted to add some interesting quick fact about the All Blacks team. Therefore, I made a short simple fact which is All Blacks is the strongest rugby team in the world, which is a fact statistically. On the terminal area, it connects to the other sub-pages that will take the reader to the three player's informational website. 

### F Pattern Explanation 

I used the F pattern for the websites other than the index page. I decided to put the content on the left side and a picture on the right side so that as the visitor is reading my website, he/she can also see the image and emphasize who each player is. Specific example is the image of Jonah Lomu. It gives more understanding of the position of wing, as he has the ball and running away from the opponent team's defender.

### CRAP Principles 

I followed this priciple by making sure the all of the websites look consistent. I minimized the number of colors im using, since the colors of All Blacks are primarily Black and White. For the important information I wanted to show to the audience, I used yellow so that they can catch the attention right away. I used red and yellow color for the hover, so that it gives the reader which webpage they are trying to click on. 

I tried to make sure all of the images are positioned in the same place. Although due to the not exact same size, the image moves little bit, but the overall location is in the right side to accomplish what I wanted for the F pattern. 

I added some margin and padding to give little space on each content and images, so they are not packed in the one spot. 

### Fonts 

I used in total of four fonts for my project - Alfa Slab One, Anton, Crete Round and Merriweather. I used these fonts becuase they share one commonality of having a kink on each alphabet. I thought these fonts will create more "POP" in my website and makes the reader not get bored on my website as they precede to multiple webpages. 

### CSS Architecture 

Although I used SMACCS for this website, since the webpage is relatively small, I only used two categories, Base and Module layout. Nevertheless, the SMACCS helped me to organize what specific content that I want to add CSS and gave me more options to explore what I can do in my website.

### Difficulties 

In this project, I was not able to perfectly balance the space between the content and the image on the player's websites. Depending on the size of the screen, the images move slightly on different position. 

Also, I wanted to implement the @media to change how the content looks depending on the screen size, but I realized that my information was too large that I could not code to make it balance. I need to make sure in the future to improve my @media max/min width skills to be able to adjust the overall content of the website depending on the screen size. 

## Reflection 

Even though there were defintely some parts that I could have made my website better, I am pretty confident of my index page. When Professor Kostin decided to use my index page to show my colleagues how to implement a Z pattern, I was both happy and confident that my Z pattern is at least in the ball park. 

One thing that I am impressed with my website is the balance and consistency with my content. My content is not long, but it is long enough to give audience enough information to understand about rugby and keep the website simple.
